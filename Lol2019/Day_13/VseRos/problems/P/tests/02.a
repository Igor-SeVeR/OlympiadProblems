  All Along The
Watchtower Words:
Bob Dylan Music:
Jimi Hendrix There
must be some kind of
way out of here said
the joker to the
thief, There' s too
much confusion I
can' t get no
relief, Businessen
they uh drink my
wine Plowman dig my
earth.. None will
level on the vine
Nobody of it is
worth Hey hey., No
reason to get
excited uh huh The
thief he kindly
spoke There are many
here among us uh who
feel that life is
but a joke But uh,
but you and I we
been through that
And this is not our
fate So let us not
talk falsely now The
hour' s getting late
Hey! Ooh All along
the watchtower
Princes kept their
view while all the
women came and went
Barefoot servants
too Well uh? ooh
Outside in the cold
distance a wildcat
did growl Two riders
were approaching and
the wind began to
howl Gotta get away-
All Along The
Watchtower
